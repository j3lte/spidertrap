Spidertrap
==========

Spidertrap is a simple web server that can be used to trap web crawlers. It is written in Typescript and runs on Deno. You can use it standalone or as a library.

## Features

- Runs a webserver that responds to all requests with a list of random links. It mimics an Apache directory index.
- Adds a `robots.txt` file that baits certain crawlers to crawl random links
- Add a `sitemap.xml` file that baits certain crawlers to crawl random links
- Optionally add a delay to the response which can be accumulated based on the path segments (the further down the path, the longer the delay)

## Installation

### Standalone

You can install Spidertrap as a standalone application using the following command:

```bash
deno install --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write -n spidertrap https://deno.land/x/spidertrap@0.3.0/cli.ts
```

> Note: You will only need the `allow-write` permission if you want to enable file logging, otherwise you can skip it.

### Library

You can also use Spidertrap as a library. To do so, add the following to your `deps.ts` file:

```typescript
import { server } from "https://deno.land/x/spidertrap@0.3.0/mod.ts";

// Start the server
await server({
  port: 8080,
  numberOfLinks: 5,
  delay: 0,
  accumulateDelay: false,
  maxDelay: 5000,
});
```
