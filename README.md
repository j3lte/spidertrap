## Features

- Runs a webserver that responds to all requests with a list of random links. It mimics an Apache directory index.
- Adds a `robots.txt` file that baits certain crawlers to crawl random links
- Optionally add a delay to the response which can be accumulated based on the path segments (the further down the path, the longer the delay)

## Installation

### Standalone

You can install Spidertrap as a standalone application using the following command:

```bash
deno install --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write -n spidertrap https://deno.land/x/spidertrap@0.2.0/cli.ts
```

> Note: You will only need the `allow-write` permission if you want to enable file logging.

### Library

You can also use Spidertrap as a library. To do so, add the following to your `deps.ts` file:

```typescript
export { server } from "https://deno.land/x/spidertrap@0.2.0/mod.ts";
```
